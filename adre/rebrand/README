This directory contains files that will replace the originals in omnibus-gitlab.

The following files are supported:

1. brand_logo.png - large logo on the login page
2. logo-black.png - small logo in the navigation bar (light themes)
3. logo-white.png - small logo in the navigation bar (dark themes)
4. devise.html.haml - content/layout for login page

The actual files in the Rails Asset Pipeline (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) are modified, which really isn't the best way to do de/re-branding.

The .png files in this repo are 1x1 fully-transparent PNG files.
Running the script with these files as-is will effectively de-brand your omnibus-gitlab instance.
Replace these files with images of your choice.

devise.html.haml is not supplied. 
Please refer to http://axilleas.me/en/blog/2014/custom-gitlab-login-page/ for more information on overriding this file.
