ADRE is a quick-and-dirty way to systematically de-brand (and re-brand) your omnibus-gitlab instance.

The script works by offering a consistent way of replacing some branding-related files on each reconfigure.

structure
---------

This folder usually contains two sub-folders:

1. backups/ - generated automatically when file backups are made
2. rebrand/ - omnibus-gitlab file replacements

See the READMEs in each of the above sub-folders for more information.

usage
-----

To use the script, add the following line to /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb:

```
require '<path to gitlab-adre.rb>'
```

Then reconfigure and restart omnibus-gitlab by executing:

```
gitlab-cti reconfigure
gitlab-cti restart
```
